## App Idea & Features Implemented

The app is designed to make learning interactive and structured.  
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs implemented:

### Level 1: Basic Flashcards
- Create new flashcards with **question & answer**.
- Flip cards to toggle between question and answer.
- View all flashcards in a clean UI.

### Level 2: Navigation & Progress
- Navigate between multiple flashcards (swipe or next/prev).
- Show current card progress (e.g., *3 of 10*).
- Add images to flashcards.
- Mark cards as **learned** (they won‚Äôt appear again in the review).

### Level 3: Categories & Persistence
- Organize flashcards into categories (Math, Science, History, etc.).
- Save flashcards and progress in **local storage** (Hive DB).
- Added **Dark Mode** toggle.
